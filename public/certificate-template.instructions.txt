Place your Canva certificate background image here as:

public/certificate-template.png

Recommended:
- PNG format
- Keep same aspect ratio as your template (1086 x 768)
- No student-specific text in the exported image

The generator overlays these dynamic fields on top of that image:
- Student name
- Course title
- Issue date
- Batch name
- Certificate ID
